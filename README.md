Basically this is an API which take the info of one specific product from Amazon or shows the JSON objects of a searched product.

It's is deployed here, if you want to take a look: [AmazonScraper](https://lfce-amazon-scraper.herokuapp.com).

To make it work you need to create an account in [Scraperapi.com](https://www.scraperapi.com/) and get a API Key to use the endpoints.

I personally recommend to install the JSON Formatter extension to Chrome to visualize the JSON's objects crearly.
